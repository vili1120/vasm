# vasm

**vasm** is a lightweight, assembly-like, stack-based interpreter written in Go. It allows you to define and run simple instructions using a stack-oriented execution model.

---

##   Stack-based Execution

- Stack: an array of cells
- Cell: contains an integer value
- Stack pointer: the index of the current cell

- Instructions operate on the current cell

## 🚀 Features

- Stack-based execution
- Simple, assembly-style instruction set
- Easy to extend with new operations
- Written entirely in Go for speed and portability

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18+ recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vili1120/vasm.git
cd vasm
```
For development branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

### Build & Run

You can run the interpreter directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or build it:

```bash
go build -o vasm
./vasm
```

## 💡 Example Instructions

Below is an example of how a `vasm` program might look (assuming some standard instructions):

```
PUSH 10
PUSH 20
ADD
PULL
END
```

This would push 10 and 20 to the stack, add them, and print the result (`30`).

## 📦 Instruction Set

> Note: instructions are not case-sensitive

Some of the current instructions supported (check `main.go` for latest):

- `PUSH <value>` – Push an integer value onto the current cell
- `PULL` - Prints the current cell's value
- `READ` - Reads user input for a value and pushes it to the current cell

- `ADV` - Advances the stack pointer by 1
- `DADV` - Deadvances the stack pointer by 1

- `REMOVE` – Remove the value from the current cell

- `ADD`, `SUB` – Basic arithmetic operations

- `PRINTS` - Prints the whole stack
- `PRINT <idx>` – Prints a cell's value based on the index from the stack

- `LEN` - Prints the length of the stack
- `IDX` - Prints the stack pointer's index

- `END` - Ends the program

> You can easily add more instructions by modifying the instruction parser in `main.go`.
