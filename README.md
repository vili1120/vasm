# VASM

**VASM** is a minimalist low-level interpreter written in Go. It provides a stack-cell-based memory model and a straightforward instruction set for low-level programming experimentation or educational purposes.

## 🚀 Features

- Stack-pointer-based memory manipulation
- Arithmetic operations between adjacent cells
- Conditional execution
- Label-based control flow with jumping
- Simple Raylib bindings
- Simple I/O capabilities
- Clear and readable syntax

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or higher

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vili1120/vasm.git
cd vasm
cd program
go build -o vasm
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
./vasm path/to/yourfile.vasm
```

Example:
```bash
./vasm test.vasm
```

---

## 🧾 Instruction Set

View [instructions.norg](instructions/instructions.norg) or [instructions.txt](instructions/instructions.txt) for instruction set

---

## ✍️ Syntax Notes

- Comments start with `#` and are ignored.
- Labels must end with an `END`.
- Indentation is optional but recommended for clarity.
