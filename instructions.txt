## Simple cell manipulation
PUSH <value> - adds a value to the current cell and advances
PULL - gets the current value from a cell
READ - reads a value from user input and pushes it to the current cell
POP - resets the current cell to zero

## Arithmetic instructions
ADD - takes the current cell and adds it to the one before it
SUB - takes the current cell and subtracts from the one before it
MUL - takes the current cell and multiplys it with the one before it
DIV - divides the cell one before and divides it by the current one

## Label instructions
LABEL <label name> - a label is a collection of instructions that you can jump to later on. (it ends with an 'END' instruction.)
JUMP <label name> - jumps to a label. (nothing after this gets executed)

## If instructions
IF.EQ <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is equal to the value
IF.NE <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is not equal to the value
IF.LT <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is less than the value
IF.GT <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is greater than the value
IF.LTE <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is less than or equals to the value
IF.GTE <value> - executes the instructions inside its body if current cell is greater than or equals to the value

## Printing instructions
PRINTS - prints the full stack
PRINT - prints a cell based on index

## Simple instructions
ADV - advances the stack pointer
DADV - deadvances the stack pointer

END - stops the program
